# CLAUDE.md — claude-email

## Project Overview

Email-driven wrapper for the Claude Code CLI with an integrated chat relay for managing multiple Claude Code agents. Polls `agent@example.com` via IMAP, verifies that commands come exclusively from `user@example.com` (GPG signature or shared secret), executes them via `claude --print`, and replies via SMTP. Includes an MCP-based chat system where claude-email acts as the user's avatar, brokering conversations between the user (via email) and multiple Claude Code agents (via MCP tools).

- **Language / Runtime**: Python 3.12
- **Architecture**: Two user-level systemd services — claude-email (poller + user avatar) and claude-chat (MCP SSE server + SQLite message bus)
- **Test runner**: pytest (498 tests, 100% coverage)

## Required Skills — ALWAYS Invoke These

| Situation | Skill |
|-----------|-------|
| Before any new feature | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Planning multi-step changes | `superpowers:writing-plans` |
| Writing or fixing any logic | `superpowers:test-driven-development` |
| First sign of a bug or failure | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |
| Before completing a feature branch | `superpowers:requesting-code-review` |
| Before claiming any task done | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` |
| After implementing — reviewing quality | `simplify` |

## Memory (mem0 via user-scope MCP)

Every email-driven invocation starts with `mcp__mem0__search_memory` scoped to `project="claude-email"`, `user_id="bb"`, and a one-line summary of the request. Fold relevant hits into the reply or plan.

Persist durable facts with `mcp__mem0__add_memory` at the same scope when the user asks to remember something, or when an incident, sender preference, or routing quirk surfaces. Skip storing anything already captured in code, git log, or this file.

```

### Key invariants
- `security.py` never imports from `executor.py`, `poller.py`, or `mailer.py`
- All subprocess calls use `shell=False`
- All TLS connections use `ssl.create_default_context()` (verified, not default unverified)
- `processed_ids.json` is the idempotency store — never delete it in production
- `claude-chat.db` is the shared SQLite database (WAL mode) — used by both services

### Chat system
- **claude-email** is the user's avatar on the chat bus — routes emails to agents, relays agent messages back as emails
- **claude-chat** is a pure MCP message bus (SSE transport, SQLite storage)
- Email commands: `@agent-name <instruction>` to message agents, `status` for agent list, `spawn <path>` to start agents
- Reply threading: In-Reply-To header matched against DB-stored email_message_id
- Agents use MCP tools: `chat_register`, `chat_ask` (blocking), `chat_notify`, `chat_check_messages`, `chat_list_agents`, `chat_deregister`

### Systemd
- Both run as **user-level** services (`~/.config/systemd/user/`)
- claude-chat starts first (claude-email depends on it via `After=`)
- claude-email can restart itself: `systemctl --user restart claude-email.service`
- claude-email can restart claude-chat: `systemctl --user restart claude-chat.service`
- No sudo required — user-level systemd with lingering enabled

## Engineering Principles

- **200-line maximum per file** — extract when approaching limit
- **TDD**: write failing test first, then minimal implementation
- **No shell=True** in subprocess calls — command injection risk
- **No secrets in logs** — never log passwords, secrets, or raw command output
- **100% coverage on production code** — `.coveragerc` omits `tests/`, the entry-shim, and standard pragma patterns; every merged change must keep the report at 100%
- **Docs follow code** — whenever a change alters user-visible behavior, configuration surface, or the test count, update `README.md` and the website (`website/index.html`, `website/fa/index.html` in lockstep) in the same PR

## Build Commands

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q      # Run all 498 tests
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v      # Verbose
scripts/check-line-limit.sh     # Enforce 200-line file limit
```

## Starting a New Session

1. Read this file
2. Run `.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q` — confirm 498 tests pass
3. Invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` before any feature work
